#Preparing for the workshop
Because we want to start without worrying about installing R and RStudio, I prepared a geting-started document. Please follow the process below and see if your RStudio and R are installed correctly before Wed, May 4. If you have issues, please let me know. 

(For those of us who attended the last workshop (June 2015), we went through these steps. But, please check your R and RStudio to make sure your laptop is set up correctly.) 

Once you think you have installed RStudio and R, please create a new project by clicking on the upper right corner of the screen.

Followed by selecting "Empty Project":

Then, select a new directory:

![alt text](images/NewDirectory.png)

Enter an appropriate directory name:

![alt text](images/NewDirectoryName.png)

You should have created a new project in a new directory. All subsequent files related this project can be dropped into this folder. Here is what mine looks like:

![alt text](images/ProjectExample.png)

If you want to change the color scheme (I like dark background, which seems to be kinder on my eyes), you can go to Tools - Global Options and select a different appearance, like so:

Once this is setup, please download the test file I created in the Google drive (https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BzryQfL97RxZNWZ6VkMzelJSSXc) called "turtle_R_Workshop.R". Place the file into the newly created directory, in my case "C:/Users/tomo.eguchi/Documents/R/Turtle_R_Workshop" and open it in RStudio then "source" it:

If you already installed the ggplot2 package, you may see a warning message. You can stop it and comment out the install.packages line and run it again. You should see some summary statistics and a plot like this: 

```{r turtle_R_workshop, echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)

x <- runif(n = 100, min = 44, max = 115)

y <- 0.96 + 0.04 * x + rnorm(n=length(x), 0, 0.1)

mass <- exp(y)
df1 <- data.frame(length = x, mass = mass)
summary(df1)

lm1 <- lm(log(mass) ~ length, data = df1)
summary(lm1)
df1$predict <- predict(lm1)

p1 <- ggplot(data = df1, aes(x = length)) + 
  geom_point(aes(y = log(mass)), 
             colour = "red",
             size = 3) + 
  geom_line(aes(y = predict), colour = "black") + 
  theme(axis.text = element_text(size = 12)) + 
  xlab("Length (cm)") + 
  ylab("ln(Mass) (kg)")

print(p1)

```

You are all set! 

#Some (unsolicited) advise and a few words on R 
R is a statistical environment that is available free for anyone. It started as a dialect of S and S+ but turned into a full fledged statistical software. I think almost all statisticians use it around the world. Other statistical packages are becoming somewhat obsolete as they are often expensive. I strongly suggest using R for all your analysis. 

R can be used alone by using the console (only for very rudimentary analysis), write scripts in a text editor (more on this later) and running them in R, or use an integrated editor, such as RStudio. There are many others but RStudio is my favorite and many others use it also. So, we'll use it! RStudio, and other integrated editors, helps with updating R and R "packages" as well as many other functions.

There are hundreds of "packages" that can be added to R to do specific analyses. Almost all of the packages can be found at the CRAN website (http://cran.r-project.org/). Finding which packages to use is a bit of art. You need to communicate with others in your field or search the Internet.

To install a package, you use the install.packages() function. For example, "install.packages("AGD")". The package supposed to have functions to analyze growth data. The installation process downloads the package (or packages) and other necessary packages, if needed on your computer. Hopefully, you won't see any error messages and it should end with a comforting message: "package \‘AGD\’ successfully unpacked and MD5 sums checked"

To use the package, you need to call it in your work space (or in your script) using the library command; "library(AGD)".  We'll go through this process a few more times as needed throughout this workshop.
